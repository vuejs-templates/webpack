# Introduction

This boilerplate is targeted towards large, serious projects and assumes you are somewhat familiar with Webpack and `vue-template-loader`. Make sure to also read [`vue-template-loader`'s documentation](https://github.com/ktsn/vue-template-loader) for common workflow recipes.

## Quickstart

To use this template, scaffold a project with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init Toilal/vue-webpack-template my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
