# vue-webpack-boilerplate

> A full-featured Webpack setup with hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction.

## Version Notice

If you are using `vue-cli@1.x`, it will be pulling the `master` branch of this template by default. If you are using `vue-cli@2.x`, it will be pulling the `dist` branch instead, which provides more configurable options thanks to new features in `vue-cli@2.x`. It is recommended to upgrade `vue-cli` as soon as you can.

## Documentation

Common topics are discussed in the [docs](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack). Make sure to read it!

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init webpack my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## What's Included

  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.
  - State preserving hot-reload
